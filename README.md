# BYUCodeTest
A repo to submit my code for this coding test for a student programmer job

Hello! My name is Caleb Hill, I'm writing this as a finishing touch for the coding test in my application to become a student programmer.

HOW TO RUN:

Option 1: Find a way to run the executable "RUN_ME" on a unix terminal:
* open up a (unix) terminal
* navigate to the main directory of this project (the same folder this README is in) and type "./RUN_ME" without the quotation marks. This will definitely work on mac, linux, msys2, linux subsystem, or another emulated environment. 

Option 2: http://cpp.sh/2dmzp
* this link will work for anyone, no excuse, as long as it stays hosted. If it doesn't work, just copy and paste the code from main.cpp to cpp.com. 

INFORMATION:
This program was written in about 3h45m, in C++(14) in the CLion IDE, on Mac OS. The code was compiled into a Unix Executable.
(I don't have a windows machine on me so I'll compile it on a windows machine to an .exe later, but in the meantime hopefully the executable will work for now. I read beforehand that the file had to be run on a windows machine but I didn't know until I was turning the file in and doing some last-minute checks that I saw that unix executables don't natively run on windows. If I had realized that I probably would have developed my solution in a different language, probably java or javascript. There isn't any easy solution to compile the code on my mac to an exe, though I just spent the last hour and a half researching and trying to figure out toolchains and compilers and libraries and build files, but I've never learned about those and frankly it's all greek to me at this point. I know what a compiler does but I don't know how to configure a makefile or link toolchains.)

On saturday I'll try to get ahold of a windows machine to install visual studio and compile the cpp code to an executable for you to test. Sorry about that inconvenience!
