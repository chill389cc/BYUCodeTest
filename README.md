# BYUCodeTest
A repo to submit my code for this coding test for a student programmer job

Hello! My name is Caleb Hill, I'm writing this as a finishing touch for the coding test in my application to become a student programmer.


INFORMATION:
This program was written in about 3h45m, in C++(14) in the CLion IDE, on Mac OS. The code was compiled into a Unix Executable.

HOW TO RUN:
open up a terminal, navigate to the main directory of this project (the same folder this README is in) and type "./RUN_ME" without the quotation marks. This will definitely work on mac, linux, msys2, linux subsystem, or another emulated environment. It's been a long time since I last used windows so I'm not sure how well it's non-linux base will do in running a unix executable and right now I don't really have access to one to try it, but hopefully a shell will run it. You could also install something like msys2, which is pretty common these days, to run it in an emulated environment. I'm looking up ways to compile it for windows now...

yeah I have no idea really how to do this but I'll keep looking until I'm done. You can see from my commits that the code was done in 4 hours. 

if you want something compiled for windows, I'll keep researching when I have time, but I am pretty lost right now with all of the visualstudio libraries and intalling compilers and all that. I did it once for visualstudio but I don't have the time right now to figure it out again. I can try and have something compiled for windows tomorrow, but please let me know if the unix executable works for you thus far. 



I will try and follow this tutorial soon:

Ok on second thought this tutorial says it requires windows headers for Visual Studio, so im not sure ill be able to do that. Maybe ill just get ahold of a windows machine later.
