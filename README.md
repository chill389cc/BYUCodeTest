# BYUCodeTest
A repo to submit my code for this coding test for a student programmer job

Hello! My name is Caleb Hill, I'm writing this as a finishing touch for the coding test in my application to become a student programmer.


INFORMATION:
This program was written in about 3h45m, in C++(14) in the CLion IDE, on Mac OS. The code was compiled into a Unix Executable.

HOW TO RUN:
open up a terminal, navigate to the main directory of this project (the same folder this README is in) and type "./RUN_ME" without the quotation marks. This will definitely work on mac, linux, msys2, linux subsystem, or another emulated environment. I don't have a windows machine on me so I'll compile it on a windows machine to an .exe later, but in the meantime hopefully the executable will work for now. I read beforehand that the file had to be run on a windows machine but I didn't know until I was turning the file in and doing some last-minute checks that I saw that unix executables don't natively run on windows. If I had realized that I probably would have developed my solution in a different language, probably java or javascript. 

On saturday I'll try to get ahold of a windows machine to install visual studio and compile the cpp code to an executable for you to test. Sorry about that inconvenience!
